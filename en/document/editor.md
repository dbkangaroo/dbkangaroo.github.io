# Code editor

## Why auto-completion window show messy code on the button?
The font of code editor does not support chars encoded with current locale, to solve this problem, you shoud:
1. Open __setting__ dialog and switch tab "Editor"
2. Navigate to item __Font name & size__
3. Choose the font that could display the text with current locale correctly.
